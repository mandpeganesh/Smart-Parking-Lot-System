"""
Test Suite for Smart Parking Lot System

This test suite covers:
1. Singleton Pattern Implementation (test_parking_lot_singleton)
2. Level Management (test_add_level)
3. Vehicle Parking (test_park_car, test_park_motorcycle, test_park_truck)
4. Vehicle Unparking (test_park_and_unpark_vehicle)
5. Availability Display (test_display_availability)
6. Vehicle Equality Check (test_vehicle_equality)
7. Integration Testing (test_parking_lot_demo_run)

Note: Some tests modify spot types to accommodate different vehicle types,
which is a workaround for testing purposes. In a production implementation,
the parking spot types should be properly initialized during level creation.
